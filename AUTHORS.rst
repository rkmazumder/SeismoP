Overview
=========
Buried water pipelines experience severe damages during earthquake loading. Aging and deteriorating water pipelines are highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Improved asset management can be ensured by accurately determining the probable seismic risk of buried water pipelines networks. The repair rate of the buried pipeline is typically estimated based on the empirical equation. This tool performs scenario-based seismic damage of water pipelines.
